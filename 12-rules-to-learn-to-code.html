    <h1>Chapter 1: Trick your brain with the 20 minute rule</h1>
    <p>If you want to build your coding muscles, you need to do a few things; you need to motivate yourself a bit; you can choose to either sit on the couch and watch tv or you can choose to just code for 20 minutes, after you start buildings websites or things you are interested in, you will get so absorbed into coding that 20 minutes will turn into hours. You have to push yourself initially, after a bit, it wouldn't feel like a difficult decision.</p>

    <p>It will be painful initially, but it will all be worth it later.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 2: Code for a purpose</h1>
    <p>What is your purpose for coding? If you code boring things like finding odd or even numbers or prime numbers, that can be fun but boring to some degree. It might be more fun to think about what kind of website/app you want to create, sure you may not be able to create it as of yet, but it can motivate you to try and make it.</p>

    <p>Code a game you want to play, like a dice game, or cards maybe even chess. Do something that will motivate you, but that combines logical thinking with creativity. There is no limit on your imagination. There may be no guide to what you want to make, but that's where you learn so much more; by doing and challenging yourself.</p>

    <center><h1>12 Rules to Learn to Code <br>By Dr. Angela Yu</h1></center>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Trick your brain with the 20 minute rule</h2>
    <p>If you want to build your coding muscles, you need to do a few things; you need to motivate yourself a bit; you can choose to either sit on the couch and watch tv or you can choose to just code for 20 minutes, after you start buildings websites or things you are interested in, you will get so absorbed into coding that 20 minutes will turn into hours. You have to push yourself initially, after a bit, it wouldn't feel like a difficult decision.</p>

    <p>It will be painful initially, but it will all be worth it later.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: Code for a purpose</h2>
    <p>What is your purpose for coding? If you code boring things like finding odd or even numbers or prime numbers, that can be fun but boring to some degree. It might be more fun to think about what kind of website/app you want to create, sure you may not be able to create it as of yet, but it can motivate you to try and make it.</p>

    <p>Code a game you want to play, like a dice game, or cards maybe even chess. Do something that will motivate you, but that combines logical thinking with creativity. There is no limit on your imagination. There may be no guide to what you want to make, but that's where you learn so much more; by doing and challenging yourself.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: There is no "perfect" language to learn</h2>
    <p>There is no perfect language to learn. Each language has it's pros and cons, the better question is, what are you interested in doing with the skills and language. The difference between languages is mostly syntactical.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: Understand what you're writing</h2>
    <p>Tutorials can only teach you so much. If you see a tutorial that jumps from beginner to advanced after line 3 or uses the word "simply" too liberally or doesn't explain any of their code, then stop. When looking at tutorials, make sure to find something at your level even if you are tempted to build the next big thing. You need to learn by doing. Make mistakes, do your own research and read documentation. Create a few games like flappy birds and candy crush; but make sure you understand what you are doing and why you are doing it.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5: It's OK to Not Know</h2>
    <p>Software engineers are purportedly the profession that has the largest population of imposter syndrome sufferers. If you don't know, it's okay. Everyone needs help and you should look at reference guides, not looking at them is worse. The ability that most recruiters in programming look for is the ability to think. Knowing how to solve your issues, is what makes a developer great.</p>

    <p>The best skill to learn is to ask good questions and under the answers given. <br>
    The first option should always be to try and figure it out yourself. Then figure out where the code broke. If you still can't figure it out, then search your query or the bug error code/error message. As you grow more skilled in programming, the problems you'll encounter get more and more obscure. </p>

    <h2>Chapter 6: Be a copycat</h2>
    <p>Books are good as references, but if you want to dive deep into delegates and protocols, read the chapter on that, but if you want to learn, make something. Make things like notepad, MSpaint, a piano or even games, like Tetris, flappy birds. </p>

    <h2>Chapter 7: Be Accountable</h2>
    <p>You need accountability and commitment to learning. People don't value things that don't have value. Free things are not valued. Find ways to get assessed. Only what's measured can be improved.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8: Keep Learning</h2>
    <p>In order to stay relevant, you have to keep reinventing yourself. Great programmers relish learning new things, even if it means they become a beginner again. If your needs change, learn to use a new tool. Keep learning, stay relevant. A good resource: <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/">https://learnxinyminutes.com/</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 9: Play Foosball</h2>
    <p>You sometimes need to get away from your code to understand what's wrong with it. Code less, think more.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10: Get a Mentor</h2>
    <p>An Agile software development technique. A learner and a mentor would sit down at the same workstation and work on a problem. The learner is in charge of writing code and the mentor reviews the code line-by-line as they are written. If they are a good mentor/teacher, they can massively improve your ability all within a few hours. Good Mentors don't solve your problems, rather they practice the Socratic method of asking good questions that get you to think for yourself. Learn to think and how to approact a problem, how to break down the problem and how to frame the problem. </p>

    <p>Find programming meetups, and offer your help in return for their help.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11: Get into the Habit of Chunking</h2>
    <p>Get into the habit of breaking down your programming problem. An example of getting a robot to butter your toast;
        <ol>
            <li>Pick Up and arrange the piece of toast in the ideal buttering position</li>
            <li>Pick up a serving of butter</li>
            <li>place butter on toast with decent coverage.</li>
        </ol>
        Then you break each of these modules down even further and think about the different ways of solving the problem. For example, does the robot need to "spread" the butter? Or can it just melt the butter onto the toast? Does it need to learn to pick up a knife? <br>
        The more that you break down problems and define the issue that you're trying to solve, the easier it is. <br>
        Remember to break down the problem into solvable chunks.
    </p>

    <h2>Chapter 12: Break someone else's code</h2>
    <p>Don't become code reliance. "Never copy and paste code that you don't understand".</p>
    <p>This was very important, so I copy and pasted from the text - 
        <ol>
            <li>Copy and paste the code into your program</li>
            <li>Make sure that your program or application is functioning as expected, confirm the block of code really did solve your problem</li>
            <li>Delete the copy and pasted block of code line by line</li>
            <li>Each time you delete a line, check to see what's been broken. Does the app still run? What are the error codes? What has deleting the line of code done to your program</li>
            <li>Even if you think you know what a line of code does, delete it any way. The most important task as a programmer is to always test your assumptions against the outcome. The most enjoyable feeling as a programmer is for the real world to validate your assumptions.</li>
            <li>Swap some of the lines around. Can the same functionality be achieved with a different order of lines? why were they written in the order they were written?</li>
        </ol>
        By breaking the solution code, line-by-line, you'll learn and understand what each line does and why it's been written. Next time you have the same problem, you will understand what's going on and how to resolve it. <br>
        Find projects on Github and try to modify them, tear down the project and understand how it was build. This will allow you to become a better programmer as well.

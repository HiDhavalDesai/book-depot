    <title>12 Rules to Learn to Code By Dr. Angela Yu</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Chapter 1: Trick your brain with the 20 minute rule</h1>
    <p>If you want to build your coding muscles, you need to do a few things; you need to motivate yourself a bit; you can choose to either sit on the couch and watch tv or you can choose to just code for 20 minutes, after you start buildings websites or things you are interested in, you will get so absorbed into coding that 20 minutes will turn into hours. You have to push yourself initially, after a bit, it wouldn't feel like a difficult decision.</p>

    <p>It will be painful initially, but it will all be worth it later.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 2: Code for a purpose</h1>
    <p>What is your purpose for coding? If you code boring things like finding odd or even numbers or prime numbers, that can be fun but boring to some degree. It might be more fun to think about what kind of website/app you want to create, sure you may not be able to create it as of yet, but it can motivate you to try and make it.</p>

    <p>Code a game you want to play, like a dice game, or cards maybe even chess. Do something that will motivate you, but that combines logical thinking with creativity. There is no limit on your imagination. There may be no guide to what you want to make, but that's where you learn so much more; by doing and challenging yourself.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 3: There is no "perfect" language to learn</h1>
    <p>There is no perfect language to learn. Each language has it's pros and cons, the better question is, what are you interested in doing with the skills and language. The difference between languages is mostly syntactical.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 4: Understand what you're writing</h1>
    <p>Tutorials can only teach you so much. If you see a tutorial that jumps from beginner to advanced after line 3 or uses the word "simply" too liberally or doesn't explain any of their code, then stop. When looking at tutorials, make sure to find something at your level even if you are tempted to build the next big thing. You need to learn by doing. Make mistakes, do your own research and read documentation. Create a few games like flappy birds and candy crush; but make sure you understand what you are doing and why you are doing it.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 5: It's OK to Not Know</h1>
    <p>Software engineers are purportedly the profession that has the largest population of imposter syndrome sufferers. If you don't know, it's okay. Everyone needs help and you should look at reference guides, not looking at them is worse. The ability that most recruiters in programming look for is the ability to think. Knowing how to solve your issues, is what makes a developer great.</p>

    <p>The best skill to learn is to ask good questions and under the answers given. <br>
        The first option should always be to try and figure it out yourself. Then figure out where the code broke. If you still can't figure it out, then search your query or the bug error code/error message. As you grow more skilled in programming, the problems you'll encounter get more and more obscure. </p>

    <h1>Chapter 6: Be a copycat</h1>
    <p>Books are good as references, but if you want to dive deep into delegates and protocols, read the chapter on that, but if you want to learn, make something.
        Make things like notepad, MSpaint, a piano or even games, like Tetris, flappy birds. </p>

    <h1>Chapter 7: Be Accountable</h1>
    <p>You need accountability and commitment to learning.</p>

    <h2>Introduction: My Story</h2>
    <p>Through pain, you can find strength and courage. "If things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen." Find your sense of control over life, like keeping your room or apartment neat and tidy. It's a small improvement, but it gives you a sense of control over life. Which can give you the confidence you need to get better at other things. "Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years." To get better you have to gradually evolve. Things will not happen overnight. Start small, and it will gradually become something more over time. "I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits - a new label that excited me but also felt uncomfortable." The four step model of habits - cue,craving, response, and reward.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits</h2>
    <p>Brailsford, believed in the strategy called, "the aggregation of marginal gains", which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. "The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them together." The small changes that no one noticed, lead to massive change for the team. Massive success does not require massive action. Being 1 percent better daily for a year can equal to being 37x better when you're done. But if you get worse by 1 percent you'll decline down to zero. "Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement." We try to make a few changes, but the results, don't seem to come quickly so we slide by into previous behavior. </p>

    <p>"When we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It's the accumulation of many missteps - a 1 percent decline here and there - that eventually leads to a problem"(page 17). No one event or one moment will make you wealthy or smart. It's all about building a habit today so you can reap the rewards a year or more down the line. If you want to build knowledge, then you have to study daily, if you want to be rich, then you have build a budget and spend within your means. Progress is going to be slow, and you may not noticed the results, until a year, 5 or even 10 years down the line. "Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major charge." Habits work like compound interest, no results or very little results, in the early days, but then an explosion of results. In order to succeed you have to keep at the habit you want to create or break, and you have to make sure to break through the plateau of latent potential, then and only then will you succeed. Before this, you will keep feeling like you have not accomplished anything. Show yourself grace and patients, as you can do something a million times, and at the million and first time, is when you will see the result.</p>

    <p>You are a seed of habits, you can choose to plant yourself and grow which will take years or you can be an old oak tree, set in your ways and unwilling to change and keep keep having the same issues.</p>

    <p>"Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results." Having goals is great, but how one approaches the system is what really matters. Fix the input and the output will take care of itself. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. "It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress." Focus on the system getting better, not the goal. </p>

    <p>This is the meaning of the phrase <em>atomic habit</em>  -  a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Cersa)</h2>
    <p>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. There are three layers of behavior change, the outcome, the processes and the identity. The out come is concerned with changing your result, the goals we set. Then there is the process, the changes here are concerned with changing your habits and systems, this is where habits are built. The deepest level is teh identity, this is concerned with changing your beliefs, your worldview, your self-image and the judgment about yourself and others. </p>

    <p>Outcomes are about what you get, process are about what you do, and identity is about what you believe. Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become. If you change the identity, then the process, the goal/result will come naturally. improvement are only temporary until they become part of who you are. When your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be. </p>

    <p>The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level - individual, team, society - is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fair to put them into action. Progress requires unlearning.  Each experience in in life modifies your self-image. The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. There is a two step process that can help with this process of change; 1, decide the type of person you want to be, 2, prove it to yourself with small wins.<br> 
    Try to answer these questions about yourself - 
    <ol>
        <li>Who do you want to be?</li>
        <li>What do you want to stand for?</li>
        <li>What are your principles and values?</li>
        <li>Who do you wish to become?</li>
    </ol>
    Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps</h2>
    <p>The cat experiment by Thorndike, initially the cats took a long time, about 1.5 minutes to escape the box, but after a number of trials, the cats started to get to the exit much more quickly, by the end of the experiment, the cats took about 6.5 seconds to exit the box. "With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic. Rather then repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution." The feedback loop is as follows - you are put in a new situation, and you have anxiety, your neurological activity is high, but as you analyze the situation and make conscious decisions, you stumbling across a solution. You're exploring, and exploring and then BAM - a reward. With practice, the the useless movements fade and the useful action is reinforced. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly. The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future. </p>

    <p>The four-step pattern is teh backbone of every habit. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. The cravings are the motivational force behind every habit. Example: You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings and the emotions of the observer are what transforms a cue into craving. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won't do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can't jump high enough to reach the hoop, well you're out of luck. The reward are the end goal of every habit. </p>

    <p>THe cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn't Look Right</h2>
    <p>After doing something for such a long time, it can become second nature; your brain can just see the patterns and know what's going to happen. It can prepare you to take action and make decisions. Your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use. With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can't always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have. Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. The point-and-calling method is when you point at something and call it out. For example, point at the clock, and read out the time; this is an effective method of learning because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. They are more likely to notice  a problem before something goes wrong.</p>

    <p>Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.Create a list of all your habits. Create a scorecard, based on the habits you want to keep, and remove. (That are positive or negative or neutral) If you have questions on if a habit is good/bad, ask yourself Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity? Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Strategies like pointing-and-calling and the habits scorecard are focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which make it possible to respond in a way that benefits you.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5: The Best way to Start a New Habit</h2>
    <p>The Implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. The two most common cues are time and location. The format for creating an implementation intention is: "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y." Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. The simple way to apply this strategy to your habit is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. When your dreams are vague, it's easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.</p>

    <p>Diderot purchased a scarlet robe for himself. But then he felt out of place, so he started to upgrade his home. He replaced the run with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures.. etc. Diderot's behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: The Diderot Effect. The Diderot effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior. Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. "After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]" </p>

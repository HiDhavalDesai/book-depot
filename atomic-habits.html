    <h2>Introduction: My Story</h2>
    <p>Through pain, you can find strength and courage. "If things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen." Find your sense of control over life, like keeping your room or apartment neat and tidy. It's a small improvement, but it gives you a sense of control over life. Which can give you the confidence you need to get better at other things. "Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years." To get better you have to gradually evolve. Things will not happen overnight. Start small, and it will gradually become something more over time. "I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits - a new label that excited me but also felt uncomfortable." The four step model of habits - cue,craving, response, and reward.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits</h2>
    <p>Brailsford, believed in the strategy called, "the aggregation of marginal gains", which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. "The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them together." The small changes that no one noticed, lead to massive change for the team. Massive success does not require massive action. Being 1 percent better daily for a year can equal to being 37x better when you're done. But if you get worse by 1 percent you'll decline down to zero. "Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement." We try to make a few changes, but the results, don't seem to come quickly so we slide by into previous behavior. </p>

    <p>"When we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It's the accumulation of many missteps - a 1 percent decline here and there - that eventually leads to a problem"(page 17). No one event or one moment will make you wealthy or smart. It's all about building a habit today so you can reap the rewards a year or more down the line. If you want to build knowledge, then you have to study daily, if you want to be rich, then you have build a budget and spend within your means. Progress is going to be slow, and you may not noticed the results, until a year, 5 or even 10 years down the line. "Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major charge." Habits work like compound interest, no results or very little results, in the early days, but then an explosion of results. In order to succeed you have to keep at the habit you want to create or break, and you have to make sure to break through the plateau of latent potential, then and only then will you succeed. Before this, you will keep feeling like you have not accomplished anything. Show yourself grace and patients, as you can do something a million times, and at the million and first time, is when you will see the result.</p>

    <p>You are a seed of habits, you can choose to plant yourself and grow which will take years or you can be an old oak tree, set in your ways and unwilling to change and keep keep having the same issues.</p>

    <p>"Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results." Having goals is great, but how one approaches the system is what really matters. Fix the input and the output will take care of itself. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. "It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress." Focus on the system getting better, not the goal. </p>

    <p>This is the meaning of the phrase <em>atomic habit</em>  -  a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.</p>
